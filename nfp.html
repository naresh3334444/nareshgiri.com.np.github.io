Foreign Policy, 2077
1. Background
Foreign policy encompasses both permanent and changeable elements. While the fundamental issues related to national interest remain constant, the national priorities can be influenced by political changes within the country, shifts in the international, regional, and geo-political landscape, and the resulting new balance of power. These factors have the potential to shape foreign policy decisions.
Nepal has consistently pursued a balanced and independent foreign policy, wisely utilizing its national capacity through engagement with international organizations like the United Nations (UN).
During the Rana period, when colonialism had a significant impact worldwide, including South Asia, Nepal maintained a close relationship with the United Kingdom. However, it appeared to distance itself from the external world. With the advent of democracy in 2007 BS (1950 AD), Nepal began expanding its diplomatic relations with other nations. It actively participated in multilateral forums such as the UN and the Non-Aligned Movement, while also fostering collaborations with underdeveloped, landlocked countries on matters of shared interest. Additionally, Nepal joined regional cooperative initiatives. Subsequently, after 2046 BS (1989 AD), Nepal's identity and prestige as a democratic country increased, leading to wider international relations and a more extensive diplomatic presence. Following the success of the democratic movement in 2062/63 BS (2006 AD), Nepal's identity as a federal democratic republic, committed to peace, inclusivity, and human rights, was firmly established.
Political stability has been achieved in Nepal through the issuance and implementation of the constitution. With major political issues resolved, the nation's aspirations for a prosperous Nepal and happy Nepali citizens are progressing toward fulfilling economic, social, and cultural interests.
2. Current Status: 
The contemporary global and regional landscape has witnessed rapid changes, leading to a shift in the balance of power. On one hand, globalization has increased interdependency and interconnectedness among nations, while on the other hand, recent times have also seen the emergence of self-centered tendencies. With the evolving economic and political balance of power, predicting the future of the existing world system has become challenging.
Nepal's foreign policy aims to enhance the country's dignity and national prestige in the international community, with a focus on national interest and security. Guided by the principle of "friendship with all, enmity with none," Nepal has been strengthening and expanding its relations with neighboring countries based on principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit. Nepal's diplomatic efforts are geared towards formulating independent positions on international issues, promoting just, impartial, responsible, and cooperative international relations.
Nepal has established diplomatic relations with most countries worldwide, maintaining friendly and cooperative relations with all nations, including neighboring countries, South Asian nations, major powers, and development partners. Friendship consolidation, cooperation, and collaboration have been institutionalized through high-level visits, bilateral joint commissions, regional mechanisms, inter-governmental and consultation mechanisms. Nepal is an active member of numerous international organizations and has become a party to important international treaties. It maintains a strong presence in international, regional, and sub-regional forums. Over the past six decades, Nepal has consistently contributed to the United Nations' efforts to maintain global peace and security.
The constitution of Nepal identifies key national interests, including independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national unity, autonomy, self-respect, protection of Nepali people's rights and interests, boundary protection, and economic progress and prosperity. The constitution guides international relations towards enhancing national prestige within the international community while upholding sovereign equality and protecting national interests. It draws inspiration from the United Nations Charter, non-alignment principles, Panchasheel principles, international law, and world peace. The constitution also emphasizes conducting an independent foreign policy that prioritizes the paramount interest of the country and revisiting past treaties to ensure equality and mutual interest.
Foreign policy in Nepal undergoes changes corresponding to significant political shifts within the country. Studies conducted by high-level working groups formed on foreign policy relations in 2052 BS, 2063 BS, and 2074 BS have contributed to updating and consolidating Nepal's foreign policy.
In addition to the constitutional guidelines, Nepal's government incorporates provisions related to foreign policy in periodic plans, annual policies and programs, annual budget speeches, and sector-specific policies. Guidelines from the federal parliament also guide the government in its foreign policy endeavors. Additionally, foreign policy values and beliefs are shaped by international customs, practices, and behavior. The rights and obligations established by international law and treaties are also incorporated into the operation of foreign relations.
Foreign policy is regarded as an extension of a country's domestic policy and is centered around protecting, developing, and promoting national interests. It is reflected in the active and effective diplomacy aimed at creating a favorable international environment, garnering goodwill, support, and cooperation from friendly nations, including neighboring countries, and elevating the country's standing in the international community. Foreign policy is a critical and significant matter deeply intertwined with a country's independent existence, international identity, and foreign relations. Therefore, it requires high diplomatic competence, moral integrity, and practical skills for its effective implementation. This document formulates Nepal's foreign policy to align with the changing context, ensuring functional coherence, ease, and coordination. Its implementation is expected to facilitate clearer, more coordinated, and effective external relations, further contributing to the protection, promotion, and advancement of Nepal's national interests.

Risks:
1.	Developing a UN format and fostering coordination among all stakeholders, including political parties, to establish a unified national approach for foreign policy may prove challenging.

In a competitive global environment, the effectiveness of policy implementation could be compromised if there is a lack of economic and technical resources, as well as proficient diplomatic skills, professional competence, human resources, and other necessary assets to achieve foreign policy objectives.
